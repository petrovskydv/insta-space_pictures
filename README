# Space Instagram

This console utility can download photos from [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) and [Hubble](http://hubblesite.org/api/documentation) and then post them on Instagram

# How to install

Download the project and create a .env file. Create a `INSTAGRAM_LOGIN`, `INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD` variable in this file, which will store your login and password.
A sample `.env` file might look like this:
```
INSTAGRAM_LOGIN=<your login>
INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=<your password>
```

Python3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run at the command prompt
```
python main.py
```
